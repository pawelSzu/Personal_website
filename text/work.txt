Web Dev;;
As the lone web developer I maintain a PHP/MySQL system used by students, faculty, and staff of GSAPP. 
The system stores student records as well as allows users to reserve rooms, fill out various surverys, 
and view various reports. For the most part my job consits of making modifications/additions to the site 
from anything as small as adding a textbox to creating surveys for students to fill out and generate
reports based on the survey results. Recently I completed an integration of an outside system (
<a href="http://www.scholarchip.com/">ScholarChip</a>) into our system so that users could register 
on our site for a conference and then be redirected to <a href="http://www.scholarchip.com/">ScholarChip</a>
, which would process their online credit card payment.

Rutgers Office of Information Technology;;
IT Assistant;;
This was my first On-Campus job at Rutgers. As a part of the Work-Study program at Rutgers I was
assigned to one of the IT groups. I worked there for the majority of my freshman year. While there, I
researched for various replacement hardware (such as printers), imaged a large quanity of computers for
employees using GhostCast, and did minor web development work.

Krakowiak Restaurant;;
Web Dev;;
I was given the task of creating a website for a local Polish restaurant. The only guidence I was 
given was, <i>'We need a website, here's our menu'</i>. Despite having no artistic nor design 
skill whatsoever, I somehow managed to patch up a decently looking site. During 2012-2013 winter break
I added a back-end administrative side to the page which allows for simple and dynamic editing of the menu. 
I still occasionally make little uptades to the site whenever I'm asked.

Data Entry Clerk;;
Yet another high school job, which I held during my senior year. I was responsible for entering
various type of information into an internal database. Some of it the information pertained to
fuel consumption, delayed deliveries, and driver work hours. I would also occasionally set up mobile
phones for drivers, carry boxes, and unpack mail.

Youth Soccer Referee;;
I am a licensed U.S. Soccer Referee. In high school this was a great way for me to have some fun
and earn some money. Unfortunately, while at Rutgers I have very little time to go back home to
referee games.
