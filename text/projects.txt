The Terminal Site;;
https://github.com/ps/web_terminal;;
(Side project, Fall 2013);;
When I initially was creating this site I had a hard time coming up with a decent design, thus during that 
stage I came up with an idea to just make my site into a Ubuntu terminal. I actually ended up
finishing this site first and then got to creating a terminal version. What I mean by terminal
version is that you can browse the content of this site in the same manner in which you
navigate a terminal. The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ps/web_terminal" target="_blank">
Github</a> and the live version can be found <a href="http://terminal.pawel.pw" target="_blank">here</a>.

Smart Dino;;

(HackNY, Columbia Univserity Spring 2013);;
This was my first solo hackathon hack. The little service would first check the users' GMail inboxes 
for a specific email that they were waiting for. The users would input their GMail
account information as well as a keyword to look for in emails. If such keyword was found in an email, 
Smart Dino would send that email to the provided phone number via text message. The hack was accomplished
via cron job, GMail API, and PHP/MySQL. The basic code is on Github, it could deffinitely use a lot more
work, but I have not gotten around to it.
