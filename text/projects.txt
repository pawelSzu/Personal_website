Drinker's Guide;;
http://kevinalbs.com/drinkersGuide;;
(Notable Class Project, Fall 2013);;
While this project was done for a database class at Rutgers University, I still find it worthy of 
being listed here since it was both fun yet challenging at the same time. The basis for the project 
was to expand on the in-class example schema of beer-bar-drinker. Along with my project partner, 
<a href="http://kevinalbs.com" target="_blank">Kevin Alberston</a>, we decided to make our project about bar safety. Just to name 
a few, we generated random data, with various patterns implanted, for drinkers, sex offenders (with real pictures 
scraped from Florida predators website), consumption for drinkers, as well as many more. There is still a bit 
more to this project than what is here in this description so check out the live version 
<a href="http://kevinalbs.com/drinkersGuide" target="_blank">here</a>. 
Check out the 'Technical' section of the site for some of the 'mean' queries behind the scenes as well 
as the source code <a href="https://github.com/ps/Drinkers_Guide" target="_blank">here</a> on Github. Feel free to attack me 
with more questions about this.

The Terminal Site;;
http://terminal.pawel.pw;;
(Side project, Fall 2013);;
When I initially was creating this site I had a hard time coming up with a decent design, thus during that 
stage I came up with an idea to just make my site into a Ubuntu terminal. I actually ended up
finishing this site first and then got to creating a terminal version. What I mean by terminal
version is that you can browse the content of this site in the same manner in which you
navigate a terminal. The source code is up on <a href="https://github.com/ps/web_terminal" target="_blank">
Github</a> and the live version can be found <a href="http://terminal.pawel.pw" target="_blank">here</a>.

Smart Dino;;
https://github.com/ps/Smart_Dino;;
(HackNY, Columbia Univserity Spring 2013);;
This was my first solo hackathon hack. The little service would first check the users' GMail inboxes 
for a specific email that they were waiting for. The users would input their GMail
account information as well as a keyword to look for in emails. If such keyword was found in an email, 
Smart Dino would send that email to the provided phone number via text message. The hack was accomplished
via cron job, GMail API, and PHP/MySQL. The code can be found on Github 
<a href="https://github.com/ps/Smart_Dino" target="_blank">here</a>.
