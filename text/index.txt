I am a sophomore at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu">Rutgers University</a> double majoring in <a href="http://cs.rutgers.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://math.rutgers.edu">Mathematics</a>.
On a programming note, I find MySQL JOINS to be awesome! <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-sql-joins-mysql-database/">Click here</a>to see the webpage that I like to frequent to as a reference guide.
On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86 Assembly</a> note.. Even though I have not done much work with it, I've grown to appreciate the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow#Jump_on_Overflow">overflow jumps</a>. In all of the programming languages that I've worked with I had to think of some elaborate way to detect whether an overflow had occured while in x86 you can simply use 'jo' or 'jno'.
