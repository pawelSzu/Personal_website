I am a junior at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers University</a> double majoring 
in <a href="http://cs.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and 
<a href="http://math.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Mathematics</a>.;;
On a programming note, I find MySQL JOINS to be awesome!

On the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86" target="_blank">x86 Assembly</a> note.. Even though I have not done 
much work with it, I've grown to appreciate the 
<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow#Jump_on_Overflow" target="_blank">overflow jumps</a>. 
In all of the programming languages that I've worked with I had to think of some elaborate way to detect 
whether an overflow had occured while in x86 you can simply use 'jo' or 'jno'.;;
