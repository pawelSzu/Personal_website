				Yet another high school job, which I held during my senior year. I was responsible for entering
				various type of information into an internal database. Some of it the information pertained to
				fuel consumption, delayed deliveries, and driver work hours. I would also occasionally set up mobile
				phones for drivers, carry boxes, and unpack mail.

				I am a licensed U.S. Soccer Referee. In high school this was a great way for me to have some fun
				and earn some money. Unfortunately, while at Rutgers I have very little time to go back home to
				referee games.
