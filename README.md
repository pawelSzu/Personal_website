There's a cool replication of a Ubuntu terminal that I'm in the process of incorporating into my website. It can be found in the 'terminal' folder above. The live version of it can be found at http://www.pawel.pw/terminal
--The only command that actually works as of right now is 'clear'. All the other commands will be 'unrecognized', but the 'terminal' does overflow text nicely with a scroll bar on the side.
